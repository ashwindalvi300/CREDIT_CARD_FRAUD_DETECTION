# CREDIT_CARD_FRAUD_DETECTION
## Introduction
Credit card fraud is a common and costly problem that affects both consumers and financial institutions. This project uses machine learning techniques to build a model that can identify potentially fraudulent credit card transactions and help prevent financial losses.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- Model development: Building and training machine learning models.
- Model evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- Deployment: Deploying the model for real-time fraud detection.
